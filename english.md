# Welcome!

Romanian version [here](index.html).

**Poligon Educational** is a project promoting science education, as well as
science communication for the curious minds.

We offer private tutoring, closely monitoring the school curricula, and custom
courses, for which we make the best plan to suit your background and learning objectives.

Here, every lesson is full of discussions, examples, applications, and digital tools
that enrich the experience and show insights that you most schools miss. 

We combine history of science, philosophy of science, as well as technology, games, 
and literature into a package that delivers the best optimized lessons for your study.

## Private Tutoring
If you find it hard to adapt to your school's demands, you're swamped by homework
and tests, or exams frighten you, let's work together into easing your tasks and
giving you peace of mind!

Here's what you should know:

* We teach **mathematics, computer science, and physics**. Our professors have
years of academic and teaching experience, as well as a passion for education.

* Any goal is within reach! If you're preparing for national or international exams
(such as the baccalaureate, SAT, IB, GRE), or you have difficulties with your college or faculty, we're here to help!

* We speak Romanian (natively), English, and French. *International students, vous êtes les bienvenu(e)s!*

* **No purchase of teaching materials!** We will work with your manuals, lecture notes,
exercise sheets, past or mock exams, plus our solid digital and physical library.
Any materials we have ― PDFs or physical books ―, you can use for free while studying with us!
Plus, we will send homework, exercise sheets, lecture notes and everything you need right to your
inbox or push it to a shared cloud folder of ours. Just focus on your learning.

* The lessons will take place either in Bucharest (Titan, Sector 3), or online (on our Teams classes). Your choice. 
If you're away and don't want to miss your class, we can combine in-person with online teaching, no problem. Just focus on your learning.

* We usually work one-on-one, but if you have friends who want to join you, bring them in and you'll both get discounts.
No group will exceed 3-4 students, however, and we promise to match you strictly with similar students.
Don't like group work? No problem: let us know and we'll arrange individual teaching for no extra costs. Just focus on your learning.

Ready to learn? Use the [contact](#contact) section and get in touch.
We offer a free one-on-one consultation to get to know each other and help you decide.

Undecided? Use the [contact](#contact) section and get in touch.
We reply to *all* messages straight away.

## Custom Courses
When you're curious for more, we offer custom courses, which anyone could join.
We put together the curricula to match your level and objectives and start learning.

We do our best to have a flexible schedule and most courses will be held online.
However, in-person meetings are also available in Bucharest.

### How Much?
There are 3 tiers:

✅ *the essential package*, with 5 meetings (approximately 10 hours), which costs 700 RON (approx. 140 EUR);

✅ *the detailed package*, with 10 meetings (approximately 20 hours), which costs 1200 RON (approx. 240 EUR);

✅ *the premium package*: for an extra 50% of the package cost, you will receive the meeting recordings, all the recommended reading materials in PDF, and all the slides used in all presentations.

All packages include free access to a WhatsApp group, for further discussion and sharing.

Get in touch via [email](mailto:adrianmanea@poligon-edu.ro) or [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/40750408128) for a free initial discussion and let's build together the course you will love!

## Courses Portfolio
### History and Philosophy of Mathematics or The Set of Real Numbers
We focus on a seemingly simple, but profound topic, which is has a very rich
history: the set of real numbers. We will talk about sets, about numbers, and 
answer questions such as *What makes numbers like e or π real?*

### Literary Science
When reading novels or any kind of literature, if you focus on the subtle mathematics therein,
then you're ready to meet multidimensional spaces, with trees and graphs and diagrams that
get more and more intricate as you're advancing through the story.

We start with modern and contemporary literary works and invite you to discover the mathematics
subtleties that make up the worlds they build.

### On Symmetry: Aesthetics, Mathematics, Natural Science
Symmetry is all around us, everyone has an intuitive understanding of what it is.
However, a rigorous definition is not easy to formulate, since the concept feels
so basic that everyone knows it, right?

What are the origins of symmetry? Etymology speaks about measurements,
but most of us see it as a qualitative feature, not as a number.

How did it become a fundamental concept in science, art, and philosophy?

Find out more [here](symmetry.html).

### Music: Language, Mathematics, Physics
Good music has a message and it speaks to all of us. Hence, it is a language.
But it is also one of the most abstract: its words are written with signs
that not many of us could actually read, and the message is not always clear.

The rules and patterns that make up scales and patterns are mostly mathematical.

At the same time, music speaks through sounds: air vibrations which are physical waves,
hence obey the laws of classical physics.

How do all of these features come together to make what we all know music is?
What can we learn from Oliver Sacks and Leonard Bernstein about the role of music
in our lives? What does *generative music* or *Euclidean rhythms* mean anyway?

Find out more [here](music.html).

### Gamification and Game Design Concepts in Education
Games are really good digital tools for learning, when chosen and studied properly.
This is equally true for video games, board games, and the mathematical study of *game theory*.

Choose your own adventure and let us guide you through multiple concepts of game design,
character design, gameplay, and reward psychology which you can use to boost your learning.

Find out more [here](game_design.html).

### Level up!
Turn your passion for games and gaming into a social and learning experience!

Games have much more to offer than fun, red eyes, and time flying.
There's strategy, planning, creativity, imagination, all of which come together
in the challenges you face, in that quest you struggle to finish or in that boss
that you want to master. When there's also a group involved, your experience becomes richer.

Come join our club and let's discuss, analyze, talk, and write about games. And play,
obviously!

If you're between 13 and 17 years old and live in Bucharest, gather your party and level up!

## About
Poligon Educational started officially in 2022, but it was only a natural extension of my passion
for science education and communication that I felt ever since finishing high school. I wanted to
put them to good public use and also meet people with similar passion and curiosity.

I'm [Adrian Manea](https://adrianmanea.xyz/english.html), PhD. in Mathematics since 2016, teacher, 
and science communicator with an academic background and more than 15 years of 
private and public teaching experience.

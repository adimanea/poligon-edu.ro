**Poligon Educational** is a project promoting science education, as well as
science communication for the curious minds.

We offer private tutoring, closely monitoring the school curricula, and custom
courses, for which we make the best plan to suit your background and learning objectives.

Here, every lesson is full of discussions, examples, applications, and digital tools
that enrich the experience and show insights that you most schools miss. 

We combine history of science, philosophy of science, as well as technology, games, 
and literature into a package that delivers the best optimized lessons for your study.

## About
Poligon Educational started officially in 2022, but it was only a natural extension of my passion
for science education and communication that I felt ever since finishing high school. I wanted to
put them to good public use and also meet people with similar passion and curiosity.

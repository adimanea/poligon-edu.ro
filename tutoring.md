# Private Tutoring
If you find it hard to adapt to your school's demands, you're swamped by homework
and tests, or exams frighten you, let's work together into easing your tasks and
giving you peace of mind!

Here's what you should know:

* [Adrian Manea](https://adrianmanea.xyz/english.html) is our founder and head teacher, who collaborates with
like-minded teachers and academics to offer the optimal learning experience for all students.

* We teach **mathematics, computer science, and physics**. Our professors have
years of academic and teaching experience, as well as a passion for education.

* Any goal is within reach! If you're preparing for national or international exams
(such as the baccalaureate, SAT, IB, GRE), or you have difficulties with your college or faculty, we're here to help!

* We speak Romanian (natively), English, and French. *International students, vous êtes les bienvenu(e)s!*

* **No purchase of teaching materials!** We will work with your manuals, lecture notes,
exercise sheets, past or mock exams, plus our solid digital and physical library.
Any materials we have ― PDFs or physical books ―, you can use for free while studying with us!
Plus, we will send homework, exercise sheets, lecture notes and everything you need right to your
inbox or push it to a shared cloud folder of ours. Just focus on your learning.

* The lessons will take place either in Bucharest (Titan, Sector 3), or online (on our Teams classes). Your choice. 
If you're away and don't want to miss your class, we can combine in-person with online teaching, no problem. Just focus on your learning.

* We usually work one-on-one, but if you have friends who want to join you, bring them in and you'll both get discounts.
No group will exceed 3-4 students, however, and we promise to match you strictly with similar students.
Don't like group work? No problem: let us know and we'll arrange individual teaching for no extra costs. Just focus on your learning.

# On Symmetry: Aesthetics, Mathematics, Natural Science
Symmetry is a feature we all recognize and think we understand. We are so used
to seeing symmetrical objects, which we perceive as easy to understand,
pleasant, beautiful.

But symmetry is not only about visual elements, patterns, shapes and
geometry of architecture and art. There are also symmetric words or
numbers, the so-called *palindromes*, which are the same when read either
from right to left and from left to right. The most famous is the phrase:

> A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.

or numbers such as 12321.

What exactly does it mean that a shape is symmetric? How can one describe
this in an abstract way? And how many types of symmetry are there?

Historically speaking, symmetry is etymologically related to measurements.
The Greek words *sym* + *metron* meaning "the same measurement" were used
to refer to it. But symmetric objects are not necessarily "the same measurement"
(let alone the fact that one could refer to symmetries of the same object,
hence there are none others to compare measurements with).

To understand how a concept relating to measurements became connected to
aesthetics, to visual properties, one has to look at the historical development
of symmetry. It did start in Ancient Greece, but the modern approach
sees it in *crystallography*, the science that studies the geometric properties
of crystal substances such as salt, sugar, and more.

Then, nineteenth century modern algebra used even more abstract tools to
refer to symmetry, making *symmetry groups*. These concepts still kept elements
of geometry and "looks", but brought symmetry closer to abstract mathematical
treatment.

Physics also used symmetry in general and symmetry groups in particular
to characterize quantum properties. Subatomic particles were said to have
symmetry properties, but what does it mean?

Speaking about meaning, in an intuitive sense, one could also ask
*What is the ultimate object or concept that is symmetric?* Is it space?
Maybe, since up-down-left-right are mere conventions. Is it time?
Definitely not!

Also, psychologically speaking, would it be possible that symmetry
doesn't exist and it is only the manifestation of our brains giving up
on understanding the actual complexity of the world? That is, could
symmetry be an automatic simplification that our brains apply to
everything we see and understand, since it cannot grasp its full complexity?

Clearly, symmetry helps us understand the world, gives us comfort in exploring it.
But could we imagine a world that is *completely asymmetric*?

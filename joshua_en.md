Hey there!

I'm Patrick-Joshua Biro, researcher in training and teacher.

My activity includes teaching science, promoting the importance of education
for community welfare, as well as presenting scientific concepts in popular ways.

I've always valued highly the curiosity to ask interesting questions about
various aspects of the world we live in.

## Education
I graduated from the "Mihai Eminescu" high school in Oradea in 2019, specializing
in natural science. Then I went to the University of Oradea, where I studied until
2022, graduating with a BSc. degree in Medical Physics and History. Then I continued
with a Master's program in Medical Physics, and currently, I'm enrolled in a PhD.
program at the faculty of Sociology, all at the same University of Oradea.

Since I was 14, I liked to be involved as a voluntary in multiple domains.
I took creative writing courses, I helped promote the rights of people living
with disabilities, and took part at events of the scientific community.

In 2024, I graduated an intensive special Training of Trainers Course.

## Professional Achievements
I like assisting others reach their potential and helping them see
that their efforts amount to something. For this, I became more disciplined
myself since high school. In the tenth grade, I competed in the History Olympiad in 2017,
where I finished with a Second Prize in the Final Leg.

One year later, I tried again and got a honorable mention, as well as
the High Commendation Award in the Global Essay Prize contest organized
by the John Locke Institute in Oxford.

During my academic studies, I gave more than ten talks at national conferences,
as well as at an international podcast on radiotherapy.

I adapted my MSc. thesis in a book in Romanian, titled 
[„Dincolo de manual: explorări didactice în fizica atomică, nucleară și medicală”](https://www.librarie.net/p/502610/dincolo-de-manual-explorari-didactice-in-fizica-atomica-nucleara-si-medicala).

Through all these experiences, I became more willing and more apt to understand
people around me. I am no stranger to burnout and doubts that creep in from
time to time, but they motivate me to bring more clarity in science teaching
and all my activity.
